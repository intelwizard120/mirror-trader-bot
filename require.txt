its very simple. there is a wallet which i want to copytrade. it buys token on uniswap and sushiswap, its both univ2 protokoll
so we just monitor wallet tx and filter these tx to copytrade
we have blacklist with token contracts like DAI USDT USDC and so on cause these trades not interesting
master wallet always using WETH to buy and sell back to WETH
the value of master wallet trades is mostly between 0.1 and 5 eth
but i dont want copy trade 1:1 as its suspicious then. so i need parameter to set. i was thinking about range faktor

for example set range faktor to 0.8-1.2 then our script choose random number between 0.8 and 1.2 and multiply with tolen amount from master wallet trade

master wallet buys 1000 token xy, our random faktor is 0.9 so we buy just 900 token xy

so i need 2 variables range_from and range_till for example 0.8 and 1.2.


Require:
Using Uniswap
monitoring transactions
blacklist DAI USDT USDC
WETH and token
range_from range_till random
